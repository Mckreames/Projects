      <h3>Here's what Matt made her do that day:</h3>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">8am - </span>Mow the entire lawn. Front and Back</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">9am - </span>Weed eat everything. And I mean EVERYTHING</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">10am - </span>Repair the garden hose and replant the flowers she weed eated</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">11am - </span>Cut any grass she left behind by hand with a pair of safety scissors</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">12pm - </span>Stared deeply into each others eyes as they pondered life as a blade of grass. Simple. Peaceful. Pointless. Amen.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">1pm - </span>Cut down three 70 ft trees using only her nails and teeth</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">2pm - </span>UNLEASH. RAGE.</li>
        <li><Span style="font-weight: bold">3pm - </Span>Late lunch break</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">4pm - </span>MASSIVE hour-long crap</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">5pm - </span>Tried using a plunger... Didn't work. Installed new toilet</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">6pm - </span>Smoke a joint with Ezra</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">7pm - </span>Mow the entire lawn again, but this time, she's high</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">8pm - </span>Become paranoid and weed eat agressively at the blades of grass that are now coming to life</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">9pm - </span>Succumb to the grass. Smell the grass. Feel the grass. Want the grass. Become. The grass.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">10pm - </span>Make Ezra cook dinner</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">11pm - </span>Sleep and dream of cutting grass</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Matt, with the help of his son, Ezra, proceeded to stay up the rest of the night chugging Dr. Pepper and singing American classics like
         "Party in the USA" by Hannah Montana, "Goofy Goober" by Spongebob, and, most importantly, "Sweet Caroline" by whoever sang that song.</p>
      <div class="amen">
        <p><span>Amen</span></p>
